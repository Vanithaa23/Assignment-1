				<h3 class="heading2">CROPPING SYSTEMS</h3>
				<p>Monoculture is the practice of growing a single crop in a given area, where polyculture involves growing multiple crops in an area. Monocropping (or continuous monoculture) is a system where the same crop is grown in the same area for a number of growing seasons. Many modern farms are made up of a number of fields which can be cultivated separately and thus can be used in a crop rotation sequence. Crop rotation has been employed for thousands of years, and has been widely found to increase yield and prevent harmful changes to the soil environment that limit productivity in the long-term.</p>

				<h3 class="heading2">MIXED SYSTEMS</h3>
				<p>Mixed farming is an agrarian system that comprises farming along with the raising of livestock simultaneously. When on a farm along-with crop production, some other agriculture based practice like poultry, dairy farming or bee keeping etc. is adopted, then this system of farming is known as mixed farming. It is the dominant system in Europe and now in parts of India, where most farms have a mixture of fields and pastures.</p>

				<h3 class="heading2">PARENNIAL CROPS</h3>
				<p>Perennial crops are crops developed to reduce inputs necessary to produce food. By greatly reducing the need to replant crops from year-to-year, perennial cropping can reduce topsoil losses due to erosion, increase biological carbon sequestration within the soil, and greatly reduce waterway pollution through agricultural runoff. Perennial plants are not new to agriculture; plants such as apples and alfalfa are perennials that are already commercially grown and harvested. However, most farmland is devoted to annual agriculture.</p>

			<div>
				<h3 class="heading2">LIVESTOCK</h3>
				<p>Livestock are domesticated animals raised in an agricultural setting to produce commodities such as food, fiber, and labor. The term is often used to refer solely to those raised for food, and sometimes only farmed ruminants, such as cattle and goats.Animal husbandry practices have varied widely across cultures and time periods. Originally, livestock were not confined by fences or enclosures, but these practices have largely shifted to intensive animal farming, sometimes referred to as "factory farming".</p>
